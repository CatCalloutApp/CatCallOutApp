## Background
For the vast majority of women, public spaces arenâ€™t necessarily safe. Over 99% of American have been a victim of street harassment. Beyond being unpleasant, street harassment runs the risk of escalating into something more aggressive and dangerous. What if there was a way to avoid it?

CatCallOut is a civic tech initiative to make our streets safer. We are a team of three developers, committed to building a mobile app that aggregates data about incidents of street harassment, and displays this data on a map. This way, everyone can see street harassment danger zones - and plan routes to avoid these areas.

## MVP Functionality

CatCallOut is built on a decoupled architecture featuring:
 * Rails API backend
 * React Native frontend

*Rails API backend features*
* Stores and persists user-generated reports
* Parses and passes JSON to the frontend

*React Native frontend features*
* Allows user to call out street harassment
* Shows all past reports of street harassment on the map
* Manages routing and state via React Native Router Flux

## Flow
* See street harassment geolocated on the map
* Search for street harassment reports by location
* Call out street harassment by noting location, date, time, and relation to the incident 
* See your call out rendered alongside other reports

## Future Features
* Provide more details about what happened
* Confirm details of report and edit call outs before submit
